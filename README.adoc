NOTICE: If you use `shadow-cljs` for your compiler, you can use the NPM modules directly.  The online
documentation for Semantic and the compiler are quite good. This library is primarily
useful in that it provides IDE docstrings.

If you're using Fulcro with `shadow-cljs`, then instead of this library
you can simply do these steps:

1. `lein new fulcro app shadow-cljs nodemo`
2. `npm install semantic-ui-react --save`
3. `npm install`

Then in some namespace:

```
(ns your-app
  (:require
    [fulcro.client.dom :as dom]
    ["semantic-ui-react" :refer [Dropdown DropdownItem DropdownMenu]]))

(defn ui-dropdown [& args] (dom/macro-create-element Dropdown args))
(defn ui-dropdown-menu [& args] (dom/macro-create-element DropdownMenu args))
(defn ui-dropdown-item [& args] (dom/macro-create-element DropdownItem args))

(defsc SomeComponent [this props]
  (ui-dropdown {:text "Filter"}
    (ui-dropdown-menu {}
      (ui-dropdown-item {} "A")
      (ui-dropdown-item {} "B"))))
```

You can also require individual *modules* with this approach by 
doing require on the *module files* instead of the top-level `semantic-ui-react` name, which 
can result in a much smaller production build.

== Semantic UI Wrapper

A library to interface with Semantic UI React. The NPM support in Clojurescript
is not yet advanced enough to support using Semantic UI directly, and 
the cljsjs support leaves a few things to be desired:

1. You have to extract each component into a local symbol
2. You have to make a React factory for each element
3. There are no doc strings

This library is a simple set of cljs wrappers around the `cljsjs/semantic-ui-react`
package that makes it a bit easier to use:

- It includes symbols in `icons.cljs` for all of the icon names (800+)
- It includes factory functions in `factories.cljs` for all of the elements, modules, etc.
   - The names are prefixed with `ui-` and converted from camel-case to hyphenated names.
   - The factory functions have doc strings that summarize the props available

== Usage

1. Add the dependency to your project. Be sure to include your desired version of semantic-ui-react as well. The latest
version of both are:
+
image::https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/fulcrologic/semantic-ui-react-wrappers.svg[link="https://clojars.org/fulcrologic/semantic-ui-react-wrappers"]
image::https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/cljsjs/semantic-ui-react.svg[link="https://clojars.org/cljsjs/semantic-ui-react"]
+
2. Make sure you've include the semantic UI CSS (via CDN or by pulling them from that project)
3. Use the provided factories and icons!
You can either use the monolithic `factories` namespace which will pull in all of semantic-ui-react
+
```clj
(ns app.ui
  (:require [fulcrologic.semantic-ui.factories :as f]
            [fulcrologic.semantic-ui.icons :as i])

...
(f/ui-button {:content       "Like"
                  :icon          i/heart-icon
                  :label         {:as "a" :basic true :pointing "right" :content "2,000"}
                  :labelPosition "left"})
...
```
or use individual modules
+
```clj
(ns app.ui
  (:require [fulcrologic.semantic-ui.modules.button :refer [ui-button]
            [fulcrologic.semantic-ui.icons :as i])

...
(ui-button {:content       "Like"
            :icon          i/heart-icon
            :label         {:as "a" :basic true :pointing "right" :content "2,000"}
            :labelPosition "left"})
...
```


== Porting from Semantic UI React Documentation Examples

Props are required. The factories will convert them to js for you, but if you want every ounce of
possible speed you can pre-tag your props with `#js`. Note that the "nested" elements with dot
notation become just hyphenated names (e.g. `Button.Group` -> `ui-button-group`,
and `List.List` -> `ui-list-list`):

React Version:
```
<Button
  content='Like'
  icon='heart'
  label={{ as: 'a', basic: true, content: '2,048' }}
  labelPosition='right'/>

<Button.Group>
   <Button icon>
     <Icon name='align left' />
   </Button>
   <Button icon>
     <Icon name='align center' />
   </Button>
   <Button icon>
     <Icon name='align right' />
   </Button>
   <Button icon>
     <Icon name='align justify' />
   </Button>
</Button.Group>
```

This library:

```
(f/ui-button {:content       "Like"
              :icon          i/heart-icon ; or just "heart"
              :label         {:as "a" :basic true :content "2,048"}
              :labelPosition "right"}))

(f/ui-button-group nil
  (f/ui-button {:icon true}
    (f/ui-icon {:name i/align-left-icon}))
  (f/ui-button {:icon true}
    (f/ui-icon {:name i/align-center-icon}))
  (f/ui-button {:icon true}
    (f/ui-icon {:name i/align-right-icon}))
  (f/ui-button {:icon true}
    (f/ui-icon {:name i/align-justify-icon})))
```

== Elements, Modules, etc.

The wrappers in the `factories` and `modules.*` namespace create low-level 
React elements, which use Javascript objects for their props. The docstrings 
on these symbols are derived from the JSON docstrings extracted from the real
semantic-ui-react library.

== Icons

The `icons` namespace simply has symbol definitions for each legal string icon name. This
allows you to use your IDE's code completion to find icon names as long as
you can remember something about that name. You may, of course, simply use a known icon
name as a string instead.

== Using with CLJSJS React

Make sure you have a consistent version of React by analyzing your dependencies. Libraries like
Om have direct dependencies on React, as does the cljsjs semantic ui package.

== Using with NPM React

1. Make sure to exclude react from all cljs deps
2. Add react and react-dom to your npm-deps
3. Add a foreign lib config to cause the npm version to appear like the cljsjs version

```
...
        :dependencies [...
                       ;; STEP 1: Make sure React isn't pulled in by dependencies
                       [org.omcljs/om "1.0.0-beta1" :exclusions [cljsjs/react cljsjs/react-dom]]
                       ...]
...
       :cljsbuild    {:builds
                      [{:id           "blah"
                        :source-paths ["src/main"]
                        :compiler     {:asset-path           "js/cards"
                                       :main                 blah.core
                                       :optimizations        :none
                                       :output-dir           "resources/public/js/blah"
                                       :output-to            "resources/public/js/blah.js"
                                       ;; STEP 2: Make the NPM react also acts AS IF it were the cljsjs version
                                       :foreign-libs         [{:provides       ["cljsjs.react"]
                                                               :file           "node_modules/react/dist/react.js"
                                                               :global-exports {cljsjs.react React}}
                                                              {:provides       ["cljsjs.react.dom"]
                                                               :file           "node_modules/react-dom/dist/react-dom.js"
                                                               :global-exports {cljsjs.react.dom ReactDOM}}]
                                       ;; STEP 3: Add in the correct NPM dependencies
                                       :install-deps         true
                                       :npm-deps             {:react                             "16.3.0"
                                                              :react-dom                         "16.3.0"}}}]}
...
```

== Using with shadow-cljs

Shadow-cljs is highly recommended. It has much better integration with the NPM ecosystem, which allows you to easily
upgrade your semantic-ui-react dependency without worrying about cljsjs at all. Simply add semantic-ui-react
to your `package.json`:

```
$ npm install --save-dev semantic-ui-react
```

== Example workspaces

There are some examples of usage in cards in the src/workspaces folder. To view these, run
`npx shadow-cljs server` and browse to (http://localhost:8023)[http://localhost:8023]. Help is
welcome in expanding the coverage of the examples!

== Contributing

Ping the Fulcro slack channel with your idea, or create a github issue. It is a good
idea to do that before trying to help.

== Regenerating Factories

The factories.cljs file is generated (to automatically get the docstrings). The `user`
namespace can be run in a normal Clojure REPL, and contains a comment block at the bottom that has
the necessary command. The input files (`componentInfo/*.info.json`)
come from the real Semantic UI React project from github (clone it, install npm deps, and run
yarn build:docs to generate it).
