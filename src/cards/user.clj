(def figwheel (atom nil))

; Usable from a REPL to start one-or-more figwheel builds. Support -Dbuild-name and -Dfigwheel.port so that you can
; run any specific build(s) on a custom port from an IntelliJ Run Configuration. This is helpful when you want
; to run multiple builds, but want fast hot reload (place each build on a separate figwheel instance running on
; a custom port. E.g. in JVM Args: `-Dcards -Dfigwheel.port=5000` with parameters `script/figwheel.clj`.
